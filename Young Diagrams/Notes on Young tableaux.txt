big point. The conjufacy classes correspond to cycle types. Cycle types are partitions of n and partitions of n correspond to Young diagrams.

What's the defining representation? - loose term. Usually meaning the smallest dimensional faithful representation.

The number of conjugacy classes is the number of irreps of a group.

So each Young diagram corresponds to a particular rep (for the group, e.g. trivial rep) and young tableaux provide it with a basis.

So the diagram indicates the rep. Each tableaux can be acted upon by a member of the group. Making them tabloids gives an idea of the dimension of the representation.

So any given tableaux is fairly arbitrary. These are just sort of vectors. The real vectors are the tabloids. The main thing is the diagram. This tells you the rep.

So given some t we can define a subgroup of t which leaves the associatede tabloid invariant. R_t. There is also C_t which is another subgroup but what it means is as yet unclear.

The S_{} things are the elements of S_n that ONLY swap 1 and 2 and 3. We then cross them to get a group isomorphic to the subgroup of S_n whose elements do 123 and as 45.

Given some t which is a sortof vector in out space we can define an associated polytabloid which gives us a new vector in the space.

We show that the group acts on the set of polytabloids. So all the polytabloids that correspond to ts of a given diagram type we have a polytabloid space. So for each diagram we have a polytabloid space.

So for a given partition we have a representation. We define the Specht module as the subspace of this spanned by that partition's associated polytabloids.

So each Mlambda will have a corresponding Specht submodule.

So now we have our partitions, which are our conjugacy classes and each has an associated Specht module, which is the irrep.


NOW we bring in standard tableaux.
