--Symplectic geometry--

Properties--
Locality - differential...not entirely clear.
Linearity - linear differential equations.
Nondegenracy - so there is always a solution.
Alternating form - conservation of energy.
Closure - Hamiltonian flows preserve the 2-form if it is closed, which means that the laws of physics do not change with time.

So we take the Hamiltonian function. Get its one form and associate this with a 2-form to relate it to a vector field. We require the 2-form because its antisymmetric nature reproduces Hamilton's equations.

--Relation to the sympletic group--
Symplectiomorphisms are diffeomorphisms of the manfold that preserve the symplectic structure of the phase space and are volume preserving.

Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms are generated by Hamiltonian vector fields and are the symplectomorphisms that conserve energy.

The symplectomorphisms from a manfold back onto itself form an infinite-dimensional pseudo-group. The corresponding Lie algebra consists of symplectic vector fields. The Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms form a subgroup whose Lie algebra is given by the Hamiltonian vector fields. This Lie algebra is isomorphic to the Lie algebra of smooth functions that preseve the Poisson bracket modulo constants. The group of Hamiltonian symplectomorphisms is denoted Ham(M,\omega).



The symplectic group is the group of symplectomorphisms, i.e. linear transformations that preserve the symplectic form. I need to put this in to the wiki.



See symplectic vector spaces for the its relation between the two definitions. Symplectomorphisms must be from the space to itself to be in the symplectic group.
